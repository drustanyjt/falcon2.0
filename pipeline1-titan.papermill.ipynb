In fact, for more than four decades, the Walt Disney Archives has carefully safeguarded the most treasured items from Disney’s fabled history.\\n\\nThe Walt Disney Archives had its beginning in 1970 while Disney was still reeling over the passing of its founder, Walt Disney. At the time, Walt’s brother and the Chairman of Board Roy O. Disney, wanted to ensure that as key imagineers and animators began to retire, their vast knowledge of Disney history was not forgotten.\\nAs fate would have it, Dave Smith who at the time was researching at the UCLA library overheard Disney executives discussing the establishment of a company archive. Dave decided to take a leap and pitch them a plan to set one in motion and on June 22, 1970, he was officially hired as Disney’s first archivist. Talk about being at the right place at the right time!\\n\\nSince then, the Walt Disney Archives has curated millions of items and produced numerous exhibits for the public. For the last 11 months, D23 Presents Treasures of the Walt Disney Archives at the Reagan Library, showcased some of the crown jewels of the Walt Disney Archives’ collection. And just announced last week, the Walt Disney Archives will be unveiling another impressive “”Treasures of the Archives”” branded exhibit at the bi-annual D23 Expo.\\n\\nThe new exhibit will showcase rare pieces from the beloved classic Mary Poppins, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary next year, as well as assets from ABC’s hit series, Once Upon a Time and a treasure trove of items highlighting Disney’s long connection to all things Oz. You definitely won’t want to miss it this August 9-11 at the Anaheim Convention Center!']\n",

Together with Scopas and Praxiteles, he is considered one of the three greatest sculptors of the Classical Greek era, bringing transition into the Hellenistic period. Problems confront the study of Lysippos because of the difficulty of identifying his style among the copies which survive. Not only did he have a large workshop and a large number of disciples in his immediate circle,[2] but there is understood to have been a market for replicas of his work, supplied from outside his circle, both in his lifetime and later in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.[3] The Victorious Youth or Getty bronze, which resurfaced around 1972, has been associated with him.']\n"

The 2,525 km (1,569 mi) river rises in the western Himalayas in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, and flows south and east through the Gangetic Plain of North India. After entering West Bengal, it divides into two rivers: the Hooghly and the Padma River. The Hooghly, or Adi Ganga, flows through several districts of West Bengal and into the Bay of Bengal near Sagar Island. The other, the Padma, also flows into and through Bangladesh, and joins the Meghna river which ultimately empties into the Bay of Bengal.\\n\\nThe Ganges is one of the most sacred rivers to Hindus.[4] It is also a lifeline to millions of Indians who live along its course and depend on it for their daily needs. It is worshipped in Hinduism and personified as the goddess Gaṅgā.[5] It has also been important historically, with many former provincial or imperial capitals (such as [6] Kannauj, Kampilya, [6] Kara, Prayag or Allahabad, Kashi, Pataliputra or Patna, Hajipur, Munger, Bhagalpur, Baranagar, Murshidabad, Baharampur, Nabadwip, Saptagram and Kolkata) located on its banks.\\n\\nThe Ganges is highly polluted. Pollution threatens not only humans, but also more than 140 fish species, 90 amphibian species and the endangered Ganges river dolphin.[7] The Ganges is a major source of global ocean plastic pollution.[8] The levels of fecal coliform bacteria from human waste in the waters of the river near Varanasi are more than 100 times the Indian governments official limit.[7] The Ganga Action Plan, an environmental initiative to clean up the river, has been a major failure thus far,[a][b][9] due to rampant corruption, lack of will on behalf of the government and its bureaucracy, lack of technical expertise,[c] poor environmental planning,[d] and lack of support from religious authorities.[e]']\n",
